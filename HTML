HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It is the foundation of web pages and applications, defining the elements that make up a webpage, such as text, images, links, tables, and more. HTML uses a series of elements, also known as tags, to enclose different parts of the content so that the browser can display them correctly.
